Optimizing Hashes-
Genesis Block
A strong Hash function is needed to generate the address for each instance of a block's Genesis Entity. It must be a pure function. Hashes are used to create unique addresses, stored as poiners to the next block, making blockchains have unidirectional data flow, built on the foundation of immutability. 

This is also why python, or the usage of tuples is a great way to represent block instances on each update.
